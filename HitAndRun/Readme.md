File permissions on Linux systems are crucial for maintaining security by controlling access to files and directories. They are typically represented by a combination of read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and others (everyone else).

For privilege escalation, an attacker might exploit misconfigured file permissions to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories, or to execute malicious code with elevated privileges.
